# Workspace docks — local integration log

## Part 1 — `feat/ui-dock-shell`

- Added a single renderer owner for the right dock frame, tabs, launcher, `+` menu,
  expand/restore and two top-right panel toggles. Existing Files and Sub-agents
  keep their own data and security boundaries; the existing bottom terminal keeps
  its PTY owner and receives the grouped bottom toggle.
- Hidden Files retires its watches; the dock does not create a filesystem or
  terminal IPC path. The right dock starts empty and disabled launchers cannot
  open tools without their exact project/session scope.
- Checks: `npm run typecheck`, five focused Vitest files (82 assertions), and
  `npm run build` passed. Isolated Electron terminal acceptance reached the
  appearance-color assertion after validating shell creation and terminal reuse;
  the detached connection popover reported transparent instead of the expected
  black in that fixture, so full runtime acceptance is not claimed yet.
